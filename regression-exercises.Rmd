This document serves as my notes on this chapter as well as the worked exercises.

Note: R^2 value shows the percentage of the variation explained by the model. I belive this comes
with an extra layer of difficulty as the flexible models can overfit, thereby increasing the value.
It also doesn't provide information on predictive accuracy.

## Variance-Bias Trade-off

The mean squared error (MSE) has 3 components

* Irreducible noise
* Model variance
* Model bias

The simple average had a very low variance as it is quite stable but high bias.
The moving average on the other hand had low bias (followed the data reasonably well)
but small changes in the data threw it out of control - high variance.

Collinearity issues can increase model variance.

Underfitting: Low variance, High bias
Overfitting: High variance, Low bias

```{r}
observed <- c(0.22, 0.83, -0.12, 0.89, -0.23, -1.30, -0.15, -1.4,
 0.62, 0.99, -0.18, 0.32, 0.34, -0.30, 0.04, -0.87,
 0.55, -1.30, -1.15, 0.20)

predicted <- c(0.24, 0.78, -0.66, 0.53, 0.70, -0.75, -0.41, -0.43,
0.49, 0.79, -1.19, 0.06, 0.75, -0.07, 0.43, -0.42,
-0.25, -0.64, -1.26, -0.07)

results <- data.frame(observed, predicted)
```

```{r}
ggplot(results, aes(x = observed, y = predicted)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "grey") +
  ggtitle("Observed vs Predicted Results")
```

```{r}
residuals_pred <- data.frame(residual_values, predicted)

ggplot(residuals_pred, aes(x = predicted, y = residual_values)) +
  geom_point() +
  #geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "grey") +
  ggtitle("Residuals vs Predicted Values")
```

This plot is essentially the last plot with its axis rotated towards predicted.
It looks relatively random but it seems to slightly underpredict at the higher end of the prediction range.

```{r}
residual_values <- observed - predicted
summary(residual_values)
```

```{r}
RMSE(predicted, observed)
R2(predicted, observed)
```

## Linear Models

Why would you use a linear model? It's because their coefficient estimates are highly interpretable and has real life implication.
They are good if your variables are not correlated and if there is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variable.
Failing that, this method is not ideal. 

**Ordinary least squares regression aims to minimise bias!**

It also needs to have a lower number of predictors than observations. Collinearity needs to be mitigated.
PCA can be used for this purpose as well as removing the most correlated variables.

Furthermore, the variance inflation factor can diagnose multicollinearity.

Alternatively, dimensionality reduction regression techniques such as ridge, lasso and elastic net regression models can be used.

**Another issue is when the relationship between dependent and independent predictors are not linear**
In this case, individual relationships need to be observed. A diagnostic plot is the predicted vs residual plot. If there is a curve in the plot,
the relationship is probably not linear.

If the relationship is really complex, it's better to use more flexible models such as SVM and Neural nets.

Outliers can also mess up linear regression, as it tries to minimise sum of squared errors, things that are far are going to weigh a lot.
There is a method called Huber that can mitigate the effect of outliers.

There are no tuning parameters. But we need to be really careful using this model as there are many things that can go wrong.

The correlated variables can actually cause the model predictions to be worse.
In case of the highly correlated dataset, the conclusion was simply that a model that can tolerate collinearity would be much more useful.

PCA works well with linear regression because the principal components created will be uncorrelated. However, it really hurts the interpretability of
the model, which is the biggest advantage of using linear regression. Furthermore, PCA doesn't consider the reponse variable, only
the variability of the predictor space.

So overall, the author doesn't recommend using PCA with linear regression, instead he recommends using PLS when there are many variables or 
correlated variables.

PLS is like PCA but instead of finding the best combinations of variables in the predictor space, it finds the best
variables in respect to the dependent variable. 

PCR = Principal Component Regression.

In PLS as well as PCR, predictors should be centered and scaled.
Essentially, what they say is that PLS is superior to PCR.

The predictive power of PLS and PCR are very similar, PLS models are simpler than PCR.

These chapters really make me think that most of these introductory methods are simply not the best way to go, but 
they are mentioned first because it's simpler, more interpretable and just basic.
